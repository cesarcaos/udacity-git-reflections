What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	I guess Git identifies all the files and folder hierarchy existants in the repository folder. Some other 
	information like timestamps may also be gathered. Since a repository is not just a regular folder, I think this is
	necessary in order to Git manage multiple repositories and know what files and folder belong to what repository.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is an intermediate place between the working directory and the repository itself. It contains the
	files present in the working directory that someone wants to commit to the directory. In this way, a commit 
	contains all the files that represent the logical change. Otherwise, each file would be commited separetely, 
	although they are logically related.
